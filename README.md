reflection:
i changed the speed of my character in a different screenshot for my first edit and i made a death script and my character can respawn for my second edit.
i struggled with making the death script but neal helped me and eventually i figured it out. I also had trouble with the box colliders because they were too big and my player kept getting stuck i fixed it by making them smaller and making the platforms smaller.
I am most proud of the death script because it has no lag and it is very efficent and it works.
